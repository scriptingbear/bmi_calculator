# bmi_calculator
A Python 3 script to calculate BMI that supports both Imperial and Metric systems.
Based off an exercise in the 100 Days Of Code Python course on Udemy.
Since I live in the US I thought I'd try to make the program more flexible by supporting Imperial units in addtion to Metric units.
Behind the scenes the app converts Imperial measurements to Metric and calculates the BMI using only Metric measurements.
App can handle, under limited circumstances, both systems at once, e.g. enter weight in lbs and height in meters.

Values for both weight and height should be immediately followed by the unit of measurement, e.g. "120lb", "1.4m".
